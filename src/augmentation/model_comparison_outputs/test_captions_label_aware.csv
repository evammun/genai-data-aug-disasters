CONTENT TYPE DETERMINATION:
- This is labeled as ""not_informative"" for an earthquake with ""little_or_none"" damage severity in the ""infrastructure_and_utility_damage"" category
- For not_informative content, I should create an infographic, map, diagram, or social media post related to earthquakes and infrastructure

Since this is NOT_INFORMATIVE but relates to earthquake infrastructure damage, I'll design a technical diagram or infographic about earthquake impacts on infrastructure rather than an actual disaster scene.

MEDIA FORMAT:
- An infographic or technical diagram showing utility infrastructure with minimal earthquake effects
- The image should be informational rather than showing an actual disaster scene
- Since it's ""not_informative"" about a real disaster, it should be educational/illustrative in nature

CONTENT ELEMENTS:
- Technical diagram of utility infrastructure (power lines, water pipes, etc.)
- Annotations or labels showing potential earthquake impact points
- Minimal or no actual damage shown (matching ""little_or_none"" severity)
- Technical, educational presentation style
- Incorporation of keywords: Midday lighting in diagram, Northern hemisphere location reference, ""Observatory"" and ""Operations"" as the O-words, tilted angle view of the infrastructure

This should result in an infographic or diagram about earthquake effects on infrastructure rather than an actual earthquake scene, making it ""not_informative"" about a real disaster while still relating to the specified categories.

CONTENT TYPE DETERMINATION:
- This is labeled as ""not_informative"" which means I should create an infographic, map, diagram, social media post, or news article related to earthquakes with little or no damage to infrastructure and utility systems.

Since this is NOT_INFORMATIVE content about an EARTHQUAKE with LITTLE_OR_NONE damage severity focused on INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_UTILITY_DAMAGE, I'll create a technical diagram or infographic about earthquake monitoring equipment or utility systems with minimal damage indicators.

FOR NON-DISASTER/NON-INFORMATIVE CONTENT:
- Media format: Technical diagram or infographic
- Content elements: Earthquake monitoring equipment, utility infrastructure with minimal damage indicators, technical specifications, analytical data

The image should show information ABOUT earthquakes and infrastructure rather than an actual earthquake scene. Since it's not informative for disaster response purposes, it would be appropriate to create something like a technical diagram showing earthquake monitoring systems, or an infographic about how utilities are designed to withstand earthquakes.

Incorporating diversity keywords:
- ""Early hours"" - Can be referenced in the time stamp of the diagram
- ""Northern hemisphere"" - Can be shown in location markers
- Words starting with A: ""Analysis"" and ""Assessment"" can be included in the text elements

Distance shot: The diagram can be shown from a distance perspective showing the full monitoring system or utility grid.
