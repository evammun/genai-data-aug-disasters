    "direct_uncertainty": "As a Humanitarian Crisis Image Analyst, examine this image and provide your assessment. Some images may show actual disasters while others may show normal scenes with no disaster present. First, analyze what you see, then classify it according to standard humanitarian response categories.\n\n<analysis>\nExamine the image carefully and describe what you see related to potential disaster, damage, humanitarian concerns, and informativeness.

Whether people are present, and if so, their condition, activities, and how they appear to be affected\n3. Signs that indicate the specific type of disaster (if any)\n4. Overall clarity and relevance of the image for humanitarian response\n\nBe thorough and descriptive without mentioning specific label categories yet.\n</analysis>\n\nNow, based on your analysis, classify this image according to these categories:\n\n1. DISASTER TYPE:\n   - earthquake: damaged/destroyed buildings with characteristic structural collapse patterns, fractured houses, visible cracks in walls/foundations, ground ruptures\n   - fire: active flames, smoke, charred/blackened buildings or forests, burned debris\n   - flood: standing water covering roads/fields/urban areas, water marks on buildings, people wading through water\n   - hurricane: downed trees, roof damage, debris scattered by wind, power lines down, storm surge effects\n   - landslide: displaced soil/rocks, buried structures, visible slope failure, mud flows, blocked roads\n   - not_disaster: EVERYDAY SCENES without disaster evidence, cartoons, advertisements - if you're uncertain whether something qualifies as a disaster, choose a specific disaster type rather than not_disaster\n   - other_disaster: transportation accidents (plane/bus/car/train), explosions, war damage, conflicts, industrial accidents\n\n2. DAMAGE SEVERITY:\n   Look carefully at infrastructure and assess BOTH structural damage AND functional impact:\n   - severe: substantial destruction OR major functional impairment (collapsed walls, exposed interior, missing roofs, completely flooded areas, completely impassable roads)\n   - mild: ANY partial damage OR functional limitation (visible cracks, broken windows, damaged roofs, partially flooded areas, partially blocked roads)\n   - little_or_none: fully intact structures with only cosmetic damage AND no significant functional impairment\n\n   *Important: If there is ANY impact on the usability or function of infrastructure, even if the structure appears intact, classify as at least \"mild\"*\n\n3. INFORMATIVENESS:\n   - informative: contains clear, useful visual information for humanitarian aid assessment or response\n   - not_informative: blurry, artistic, promotional, or lacks clear disaster-relevant content (ads, logos, cartoons, symbolic images)\n\n4. HUMANITARIAN CATEGORY:\n   Use these clear distinguishing criteria for classification:\n   \n   - affected_injured_or_dead_people: Shows INDIVIDUALS in distress or directly impacted. Look for:\n     * People with visible injuries, receiving medical attention, or deceased\n     * Civilians being evacuated, rescued, or in obvious distress\n     * People in temporary shelters, receiving aid, or displaced\n     * Close-up focus on human suffering or individual impact\n   \n   - infrastructure_and_utility_damage: Shows PHYSICAL DAMAGE as the main focus. Look for:\n     * Damaged buildings, roads, bridges, or utilities WITHOUT people as the main subject\n     * Debris, rubble, or destroyed property with no individuals prominently featured\n     * Aerial or wide shots of damaged areas where infrastructure is the primary subject\n     * People may be present but only as small figures that aren't the main focus\n   \n   - rescue_volunteering_or_donation_effort: Shows ORGANIZED RESPONSE efforts. Look for:\n     * Uniformed personnel (firefighters, medical staff, military, etc.) actively responding\n     * Emergency vehicles, equipment, or organized rescue operations\n     * Coordinated aid distribution, volunteer efforts, or donation activities\n     * Focus on the responders and their equipment/activities rather than victims\n   \n   - not_humanitarian: NO CLEAR DISASTER IMPACT or response needs. Look for:\n     * Scenes unrelated to disasters or humanitarian needs\n     * No visible damage, affected people, or response activities\n     * Normal daily activities, undamaged structures, or scenic views\n     * Promotional content, advertisements, or symbolic imagery\n\n   *Important: If you see injured or affected people AND organized responders in the same image, look at what the image is primarily focusing on - the people being helped or the responders providing help*\n\nIn the <labels> section below, fill in ONLY the exact category names from the lists above.
